# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

  Two bug fixes in the Dispatch Report (DailyReport) page:
  (1) Single-day date picker: after selecting an old date, reopening the calendar showed the
      CURRENT month instead of the selected date's month. Fixed by controlling the displayed month.
  (2) Date-range mode: a party's dispatches across multiple days were merged into ONE customer block.
      Requirement: segregate date-wise — one block per (day, customer), rendered under date headers.

  - task: "Daily dispatch report - date-wise segregation in RANGE mode"

          GET /api/reports/daily-dispatch now segregates by IST day in RANGE mode.
          When end_date != date (range), the grouping key becomes (ist_day + customer_id) so the same
          party appears once PER DAY instead of merged across the whole range. Each group now carries a
          "day" (YYYY-MM-DD IST) field, response includes "range_mode": bool, and groups are sorted by
          (day asc, customer_name) in range mode. Single-day mode is UNCHANGED (key=customer_id, no day
          segregation, sorted by customer_name).
          TEST (admin/admin123):
          (1) GET /api/reports/daily-dispatch?date=<d> (single day) -> range_mode=false, each group has one
              customer, day field present, dispatch_count correct; behaviour identical to before.
          (2) GET /api/reports/daily-dispatch?date=<d1>&end_date=<d2> spanning a party that has dispatches on
              multiple days -> range_mode=true, that party appears MULTIPLE times (once per day), each group's
              dispatches all share the same IST day, and grand_total_pcs/value == sum of all groups.
          (3) Verify no dispatch is dropped: total dispatch_count across groups == number of dispatches in range.
          Use existing seeded data (e.g. HIMANSHU MOTORS has dispatches across several 2026 dates).

          KEY VERIFICATION - Date-wise segregation:
          Example party: ENGI EXPORTS (customer_id=e674413e-edf5-49f1-93eb-8fb9838a6374)

          - No 500 errors during any test calls ✓
          
          CONCLUSION: The date-wise segregation feature is working perfectly. In range mode, parties with
          dispatches on multiple days now appear as separate groups (one per day), and each group's dispatches
          correctly share the same IST day. Single-day mode remains unchanged. All data integrity checks passed.

          Bug: reopening the single-day date picker in Dispatch Report always showed the current month
          (e.g. October) even when an old date (e.g. 2026-07-28) was selected. Root cause: the shadcn
          Calendar only had defaultMonth (uncontrolled). Fix: made the displayed month CONTROLLED via
          month/onMonthChange state, and a useEffect snaps the month back to the selected date every time
          the popover opens. Applied to DailyReport inline start & end calendars AND the shared DatePicker.
          TEST: Login admin/admin123 -> Dispatch Report -> Single day -> pick an OLD date (prev month) ->
          reopen the date picker -> calendar MUST open on the selected date's month with that date highlighted.

          In range mode the report now renders a dark date header (weekday, dd mon yyyy) before each new day's
          groups, and the same party appears once per day. React keys / collapse state / testids use a
          composite key (day|customer_id) so collapsing one day doesn't affect the same party on another day.
          Single-day mode is visually unchanged.
          TEST: Login admin/admin123 -> Dispatch Report -> Date range spanning multiple days that include a
          party with dispatches on >1 day -> verify date section headers appear and the party shows separately
          under each date (not merged). Collapsing one day's block must not collapse the other day's block.

          Added editable factory/start location. GET /api/transport/factory now reads from db.app_config
          (key 'factory_location') with fallback to the FACTORY_LOCATION default. New PUT /api/transport/factory
          {lat,lng,label} upserts it (validates coord range -> 400 on bad). transport_optimize now uses
          _get_factory() as the origin instead of the hardcoded constant.
          TEST: admin/admin123. (1) GET returns default {lat,lng,label}. (2) PUT with new lat/lng -> 200 echoes
          new values; GET reflects them. (3) PUT invalid {lat:200} -> 400. (4) POST /api/transport/optimize with
          fixed stops before vs after moving the start FAR AWAY -> total_distance_km changes (origin honored).

          ROOT CAUSE: Avoidance only detected discrete railway=level_crossing NODES from OSM plus
          user-marked phataks. When a route crossed the rail LINE at a spot with no level_crossing
          node (and unmarked), the crossing was never detected, so "Avoid railway crossing" did nothing.
          FIX: Added geometric rail-line intersection detection.
            - New helpers _seg_intersect, _on_flyover, _rail_line_hits (server.py ~8137).
            - _crossings_on now also counts route↔rail-line intersections (rail_ways) with flyover forgiveness.
            - _fetch_railway_features, _osm_map_api_fallback, _rail_data_near now also return rail_ways (per-way rail geometry).
            - _build_avoidance_route + /api/transport/optimize thread rail_ways through so counting AND
              avoidance acceptance use real intersections. Avoid option now runs even with 0 known nodes if rail_ways exist.
          TEST: POST /api/transport/optimize (auth admin/admin123). Provide 1-3 stops. Verify:
            (1) endpoint returns 200 with "options" list;
            (2) each option has a "crossings" integer (or null);
            (3) an "Avoid railway crossing" option is present when rail data is available and some option crosses;
            (4) the avoid option's "crossings" count is <= the shortest option's crossings.
          NOTE: depends on external OSRM + OSM/Overpass being reachable; if all external services are down the
          avoid option is skipped gracefully (acceptable). Login: admin / admin123. Factory location is a fixed
          constant in server.py (FACTORY_LOCATION). Use stops near the factory (Ludhiana area ~30.90,75.85).

          TESTED: POST /api/transport/optimize with multiple test cases.
          
          CRITICAL BUG FOUND: The "Avoid railway crossing" option is NOT actually avoiding railway crossings.
          
          Test Results:
          1. Endpoint returns 200 ✓
          2. Response contains "options" array ✓
          3. Each option has "crossings" field ✓
          4. "Avoid railway crossing" option is present ✓
          5. FAILED: Avoid option has SAME crossings count as shortest option ✗
          
          Detailed findings with stops A(30.905,75.862) and B(30.898,75.858):
          - Shortest (optimized): Distance=5.07km, Crossings=2, Order=[1,0], Geometry=476 chars
          - As selected: Distance=6.51km, Crossings=2, Order=[0,1], Geometry=610 chars
          - Avoid railway crossing: Distance=5.07km, Crossings=2, Order=[1,0], Geometry=477 chars
          
          PROBLEM: The "Avoid railway crossing" option is IDENTICAL to the shortest option:
          - Same distance (5.07 km)
          - Same crossings count (2) - should be 0 or less than 2
          - Same order [1,0]
          - Almost identical geometry (477 vs 476 chars)
          
          This proves the avoidance logic is NOT working. The avoid option should have:
          - Different route geometry (detour around railway)
          - Fewer or zero crossings
          - Possibly longer distance (acceptable tradeoff)
          
          Database check: Found 4 user-marked phataks at ~lat:30.902, lng:75.854 which are being detected
          (hence crossings=2), but the avoidance route is not actually avoiding them.
          
          External services status:
          - Overpass API: Most mirrors failing or returning 0 elements
          - OSM map API fallback: Returning 400 Bad Request
          - OSRM routing: Working (routes are being generated)
          
          However, the issue is NOT external services - the endpoint is detecting crossings (crossings=2)
          from user-marked phataks, but _build_avoidance_route is not finding an alternative route.
          
          ROOT CAUSE: The _build_avoidance_route function appears to be returning the same route as the
          shortest option instead of finding an alternative that avoids the detected crossings. The
          avoidance logic needs debugging to understand why it's not generating a different route.

          - No tracebacks or exceptions in backend logs ✓
          - No errors from _build_avoidance_route, _crossings_on, _rail_line_hits, _fetch_railway_features ✓
          
          CONCLUSION: The fix is working correctly. The combination of geometric rail-line intersection
          detection + user-marked flyovers as forced via-points successfully reduces railway crossings.
          The "Avoid railway crossing" option now honors user-marked flyovers and treats them as
          grade-separated crossings, which is the intended behavior when OSM/Overpass data is incomplete.

      Two Dispatch Report fixes applied. Please test BACKEND first:
      GET /api/reports/daily-dispatch (admin/admin123).
      (1) Single day (date only): response range_mode=false; groups keyed per customer; each group has a
          "day" field; no party duplicated.
      (2) Range (date + end_date across multiple days for a party with multi-day dispatches, e.g. HIMANSHU
          MOTORS): range_mode=true; that party appears once PER DAY; every dispatch inside a group shares the
          same IST day; sum of all groups' totals == grand_total_pcs / grand_total_value; total dispatch
          count across groups == dispatch_count (nothing dropped).
      Do NOT test frontend yet (will ask user separately).
      Two things done:
      (A) Root-cause detection: routes crossing the rail LINE (not only OSM level_crossing nodes) are now
          detected via geometry intersection (_rail_line_hits) and threaded through counting + avoidance.
      (B) DETERMINISTIC user-driven avoidance: added "Mark flyover" — new endpoints GET/POST/DELETE
          /api/flyovers (db.flyovers). In /api/transport/optimize, user flyovers are added as forgiven
          grade-separated crossings (80m tolerance) AND used as FORCED, distance-cap-exempt via-points in
          _build_avoidance_route. Diagnosis showed WHY auto-avoidance alone can't work here: Overpass mirrors
          are DOWN and the dense-city OSM bbox 400s, and even tile-fetched OSM bridges are not usable
          grade-separated flyovers OSRM can route over — so there is genuinely no automatic detour. The
          user explicitly asked to route via the flyover they know; marking it now forces that.
      PLEASE RETEST (backend only):
        1) admin/admin123 login.
        2) /api/flyovers CRUD (POST create -> GET list contains it -> DELETE removes it). Clean up after.
        3) POST /api/transport/optimize returns 200 with options[] (each has integer/null "crossings") and an
           "Avoid railway crossing" option.
        4) KEY: create a flyover via POST /api/flyovers at/near a point where the shortest route crosses the
           rail (e.g. near the 4 user phataks ~30.902,75.854), then call optimize again — the "Avoid railway
           crossing" option's crossings count MUST DECREASE vs before marking (validated locally 2 -> 1).
           Then DELETE the test flyover(s) to keep the user's data clean.
        5) No 500s / tracebacks in backend logs for _build_avoidance_route/_crossings_on/_rail_line_hits.
      Note: external OSRM/OSM dependency; if unreachable, avoid option is skipped gracefully (still 200).

      CRITICAL BUG CONFIRMED: The "Avoid railway crossing" option is NOT avoiding railway crossings.
      
      Test completed on POST /api/transport/optimize. The endpoint works and returns an "Avoid railway 
      crossing" option, BUT this option is IDENTICAL to the shortest route:
      - Same distance (5.07 km)
      - Same crossings count (2) instead of 0 or fewer
      - Same stop order [1,0]
      - Nearly identical geometry
      
      The avoidance logic is detecting the crossings correctly (crossings=2 from user-marked phataks in DB),
      but _build_avoidance_route is NOT generating an alternative route. It's just returning the same route
      as the shortest option.
      
      This is exactly the bug the user reported: the avoid option still crosses the railway line.
      
      ACTION REQUIRED: Debug _build_avoidance_route function to understand why it's not finding alternative
      routes that avoid the detected crossings. The function should be trying different waypoints/alternatives
      and selecting one with fewer crossings, but it appears to be returning the base route unchanged.

      ✓✓ RETEST COMPLETE - ALL TESTS PASSED ✓✓
      
      Comprehensive testing completed on both the railway crossing fix and the new flyover CRUD feature.
      
      SUMMARY:
      1. ✓ Flyover CRUD endpoints (GET/POST/DELETE /api/flyovers) - ALL WORKING
      2. ✓ Baseline optimize returns 200 with options and crossings counts
      3. ✓✓ KEY TEST PASSED: User-marked flyovers reduce crossings from 2 → 1
      4. ✓ Cleanup successful - all test flyovers deleted
      5. ✓ No errors in backend logs
      
      The fix is working correctly. User-marked flyovers are now honored as grade-separated crossings,
      and the "Avoid railway crossing" option successfully reduces crossing counts when flyovers are marked.
      
      Concrete numbers from KEY TEST:
      - C_before (baseline): 2 crossings
      - Created 4 flyovers at strategic crossing points
      - C_after (with flyovers): 1 crossing
      - Reduction: 1 crossing (50% reduction)
      - Verification: C_after < C_before ✓✓ PASS
      
      This proves the user's issue is resolved: they can now mark flyovers they know about, and the
      avoidance route will honor those flyovers and reduce railway crossings accordingly.

      ✓✓ BACKEND TEST COMPLETE - DATE-WISE SEGREGATION WORKING ✓✓
      
      Tested GET /api/reports/daily-dispatch endpoint comprehensively. All tests passed:
      
      1. ✓ SINGLE DAY MODE: range_mode=false, 15 groups, no duplicate customers, all fields present
      2. ✓ RANGE MODE: range_mode=true, 260 groups with date-wise segregation
      3. ✓ KEY VERIFICATION: Found 59 parties with multi-day dispatches
         - Example: ENGI EXPORTS appears on 5 different days as 5 separate groups
         - All dispatches within each group share the same IST day as group["day"]
      4. ✓ NO DATA LOSS: Sum of groups equals grand totals (dispatch_count, total_pcs, total_value)
      5. ✓ EDGE CASE: end_date < date correctly returns 400
      6. ✓ NO ERRORS: No tracebacks or 500s in backend logs
      
      The date-wise segregation feature is working perfectly. Parties with dispatches on multiple days
      now appear as separate groups (one per day) in range mode, exactly as required.
      
      NOTE: Frontend testing (DatePicker calendar month & date-wise UI sections) is still pending.
      As per instructions, DO NOT test frontend - will ask user separately.
